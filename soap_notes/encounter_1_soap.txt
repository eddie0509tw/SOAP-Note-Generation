Objective:
The objective examination reveals that the patient's ears are clean, and the nose and throat appear normal upon inspection. The thyroid is palpated without any noted abnormalities, and pulses are present and palpable. Reflexes in the legs are checked and appear normal. Muscle strength testing shows the patient can resist pressure in various directions with arms and legs, indicating normal strength. The heart rate is slightly elevated, but lung sounds are clear upon auscultation. The thoracic spine is evaluated for alignment, and no unusual tenderness is reported. Skin examination does not reveal any scrapes, rashes, or concerning moles. The abdomen is examined, and the patient points to the area of pain. The clinician notes the need for a CT scan to assess for possible appendicitis and plans to conduct blood tests for further evaluation.
Assessment:
The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of appendicitis, as indicated by the description of pain and the physical examination findings. The medical student suspects an infected appendix and plans to consult with a surgeon for further evaluation and potential removal. A CT scan is proposed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out rupture, along with simple blood tests to check for any additional concerns. The patient has no significant past medical history or current medications that were noted. Additionally, the patient will undergo screening for sexually transmitted infections due to inconsistent condom use and lack of prior testing. The patient's heart rate is slightly elevated, but lung sounds are clear, and there is no unusual tenderness in the thoracic spine. The medical student plans to discuss the findings with the supervising physician and consider osteopathic manipulative therapy as part of the management plan.
Plan:
The plan for the patient includes contacting a surgeon to discuss the potential need for an appendectomy due to suspected appendicitis. A CT scan will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and ensure the appendix has not ruptured. Blood tests will also be conducted to check for any abnormalities. The patient will be informed about the possibility of starting antibiotics. Additionally, the patient will receive two vaccines, meningitis and Gardasil, and a follow-up appointment will be scheduled for the next Gardasil dose. The patient will also undergo screening tests for sexually transmitted infections. The clinician will discuss the importance of safe practices, including avoiding underage drinking and ensuring the use of seat belts while driving. The patient will be provided with self-stretching exercises for migraine management. The clinician will consult with the doctor regarding the patient's concerns about cancer, although current symptoms do not suggest this diagnosis. The nurse will be involved in coordinating these actions and ensuring the patient's boyfriend is informed about the care plan.
