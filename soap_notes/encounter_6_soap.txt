Subjective:
The patient, Mr. Harding, reports no known issues with his heart and has not been informed of any heart problems by a doctor in the past. He has not experienced any shoulder problems and has had his blood pressure measured before, typically during his annual check-up with his GP. Mr. Harding does not express any current symptoms or concerns during the examination and confirms that everything seems straightforward. He inquires about the purpose of listening to his heart and back, showing curiosity about the examination process. He does not report any discomfort during the examination and confirms that he has not noticed any unusual symptoms himself.
Objective:
The objective findings from the cardiovascular examination are as follows: The patient's hands, face, and chest were examined, with no abnormalities observed. The pulses in the feet were normal, and the temperature and appearance of the feet were also normal. The neck was observed with no obvious problems, and the patient was able to turn their head fully to both sides. Palpation of the abdomen revealed no pain or tenderness, and the heart was palpated with a normal beat. Auscultation of the heart and lungs revealed normal heart sounds, rhythm, and clear lung sounds with equal air movement on both sides. The back was examined with no issues noted, and the spine was palpated without problems. The patient's blood pressure was measured on both arms and found to be within the normal range. The examination of the face, including the eyes and tongue, showed no abnormalities, and the neck was palpated and auscultated with normal findings. The patient's pulse was regular and normal in both wrists, and there were no issues with the shoulder or collarbone area. Overall, the physical examination findings were normal, with no observable signs of cardiovascular or respiratory issues.
Assessment:
The cardiovascular examination of Mr. Harding revealed no abnormalities. The clinician conducted a thorough assessment, including inspection of the hands, face, neck, chest, abdomen, and feet, as well as auscultation of the heart and lungs. All findings were within normal limits, with no irregularities in heart sounds, rhythm, or lung function. The pulses in the wrists and feet were regular, and blood pressure readings were within the normal range. There were no signs of tenderness or discomfort during palpation of the abdomen, and no issues were noted with the patient's blood pressure or any previous heart-related problems. Overall, the examination suggests that Mr. Harding's cardiovascular health is stable and normal at this time.
Plan:
Plan: The plan includes completing the cardiovascular examination by reviewing an ECG, checking any previous chest x-rays, and reviewing any existing blood work. The clinician will take the patient's blood pressure twice, once with a stethoscope and once without, to ensure accuracy. Both readings were within the normal range. The clinician will also assess the pulse in different areas, including below the collarbone, and listen to the heart and lungs for any abnormalities. The patient is advised to report any discomfort during the examination. No immediate concerns were noted, and the patient is encouraged to ask questions if they have any. Follow-up appointments or further tests will be determined based on the results of the ECG and any other findings from the examination.
