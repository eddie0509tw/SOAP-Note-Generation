There are no additional symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, loss of appetite, or unusual weight gain reported.

Based on the subjective information, a physical examination is necessary to further assess the cause of the pain, and imaging tests may be considered depending on the findings of the examination.
Plan:
The plan includes conducting a physical examination to better understand the cause of the patient's pain. Depending on the findings from the examination, imaging tests may be considered to further investigate the issue. The patient is advised to discuss any questions or concerns they may have during the consultation. Additionally, the patient's medication history, including the use of morphine and any reactions to it, will be reviewed. The clinician will also consider the patient's past medical, surgical, and family history, as well as lifestyle factors, to inform the treatment plan. Follow-up appointments may be scheduled based on the outcomes of the initial examination and any tests performed.
